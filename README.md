# Custom Data Structures Implementation

This project contains custom implementations of various data structures in Java, including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap. These implementations are developed as part of a programming task and follow the specifications provided.

## Classes Implemented

1. **MyArrayList**: Implementation of ArrayList based on an array.
2. **MyLinkedList**: Implementation of Doubly LinkedList.
3. **MyStack**: Implementation of Stack using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList as the underlying data structure.
4. **MyQueue**: Implementation of Queue using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList.
5. **MyMinHeap**: Implementation of MinHeap using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList.

## Usage

Each class can be used to perform typical operations associated with its respective data structure. The usage examples are provided in the test file `Test.java`.

## File Structure

- `MyArrayList.java`: Contains the implementation of MyArrayList class.
- `MyLinkedList.java`: Contains the implementation of MyLinkedList class.
- `MyStack.java`: Contains the implementation of MyStack class.
- `MyQueue.java`: Contains the implementation of MyQueue class.
- `MyMinHeap.java`: Contains the implementation of MyMinHeap class.
- `Test.java`: Contains test cases for all implemented classes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. You can directly use the implemented classes in your Java project or run the test cases provided in `Test.java` to validate the functionality.
