# Custom Data Structures Implementation

This project contains custom implementations of various data structures in Java, including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap. These implementations are developed as part of a programming task and follow the specifications provided.

## Classes Implemented

1. **MyArrayList**: Implementation of ArrayList based on an array.
2. **MyLinkedList**: Implementation of Doubly LinkedList.
3. **MyStack**: Implementation of Stack using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList as the underlying data structure.
4. **MyQueue**: Implementation of Queue using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList.
5. **MyMinHeap**: Implementation of MinHeap using either MyArrayList or MyLinkedList.

## Usage

Each class can be used to perform typical operations associated with its respective data structure. The usage examples are provided in the test file `Test.java`.

## File Structure

- `MyArrayList.java`: Contains the implementation of MyArrayList class.
- `MyLinkedList.java`: Contains the implementation of MyLinkedList class.
- `MyStack.java`: Contains the implementation of MyStack class.
- `MyQueue.java`: Contains the implementation of MyQueue class.
- `MyMinHeap.java`: Contains the implementation of MyMinHeap class.
- `Test.java`: Contains test cases for all implemented classes.
